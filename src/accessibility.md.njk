# Accessibility

The GOV.UK Design System team works hard to ensure that the GOV.UK Design System and the styles, components and patterns it contains are accessible.

At the time the Design System went into public beta in June 2018, it had been independently audited by the [Digital Accessibility Centre](https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/) and was fully compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0).

Where possible, the team aims to research components and patterns with a representative range of users, including those with disabilities. 

It also tests components to ensure they work with a broad range of browsers, devices and assistive technologies.
## Making your service accessible
While the GOV.UK Design System team takes steps to ensure the Design System is as accessible as possible by default, this does not remove the need for contextual research. 

You need to research styles, components and patterns as part of your service to ensure that they are accessible in context.  

Find detailed guidance on [making your service accessible](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction) in the GOV.UK Service Manual.

## WCAG 2.1 updates
New regulations came into force on 23 September 2018 which state that, by law, all public sector websites must meet WCAG 2.1 by:

- 23 September 2019 for new websites
- 23 September 2020 for existing websites

The GOV.UK Design System team is making a number of updates to ensure the Design System and the codebase it uses, GOV.UK Frontend, meet WCAG 2.1. 

Read more about the [requirements for making your public sector website accessible](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps).

### If you are using the GOV.UK Design System and GOV.UK Frontend

Currently, a number of components in the Design System do not meet WCAG 2.1. 

If you are using the Design System or Frontend now, you will fail an accessibility audit on a number of things. For example:

- non-text contrast of links and various component focus states
- text contrast of the link hover colour
- non-text contrast of the tabs component

The GOV.UK Design System team has started work to make the Design System and Frontend meet WCAG 2.1. For example, they have added the autocomplete attribute to relevant patterns, like [Asking users for names](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/names/#use-the-autocomplete-attribute-on-name-fields). 

The team is also aiming to release a new version of Frontend (v.3.0.0) and a series of updates to the Design System in June 2019 that will address the known issues.

If you have failed an audit because of something from the Design System or Frontend, it’s recommended you wait for the release, rather than trying to fix the issues independently. 

If you have failed because of something built specifically for your service, for example a component you’ve designed, you’ll need to fix these separately. 

Updating to the next release of Frontend will not automatically mean you pass WCAG 2.1. You will still need your own audit to assess your service as a whole.

### If you are not using the GOV.UK Design System and GOV.UK Frontend

The Design System and Frontend were introduced in June 2018 to replace the following deprecated codebases:

- GOV.UK Elements
- Frontend Toolkit
- GOV.UK Template

The GOV.UK Design System team no longer supports these products and will not be making updates to make them WCAG 2.1 compliant. 

If you are using these products, it’s recommended that you begin [updating your service now to use the Design System and Frontend](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/updating-your-code/).

Doing this will allow you to update your service in a much more manageable way, than waiting to update straight to Frontend v.3.0.0 to meet the 23 September deadline.

If you would like to start using the Design System and Frontend, read guidance on [how to get started](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/).

The GOV.UK Design System team will keep this page up to date with updates and when the new version of Frontend is available.
